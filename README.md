# AmitVermaDce
 With 9+ years of experience, I specialize in machine learning, deep learning, and Generative AI solutions, including prompt engineering and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. I have successfully developed and fine-tuned transformer models for text analytics and generative tasks, resulting in significant improvements in model accuracy and responsiveness. I have worked on various classical machine learning use cases involving classification and regression, with an in-depth understanding of the mathematical concepts behind each classical ML algorithm, which helps me apply established techniques to solve real-world problems.

In the AWS cloud, I leverage Amazon Bedrock to integrate foundation models into my applications, supporting tasks such as natural language understanding, text analytics and image generation. By utilizing Bedrock's managed infrastructure for foundation models, I streamline workflows involving large language models, efficiently handling tasks like text summarization, content generation, and sentiment analysis. Bedrock allows me to seamlessly deploy and scale these models, optimizing both cost and performance for generative applications. This integration enables me to deliver scalable, high-performance AI solutions on AWS.

My expertise also extends to big data technologies such as Hadoop, Oozie, Spark, YARN, Nifi, HBase, and Hive, enabling me to effectively manage and process large-scale datasets. I have worked on different connectors (scripts) to perform various ingestion-related tasks, including cleaning and enrichment modules, which carry out the ELT process—extracting, loading, and transforming data into optimized formats—ensuring seamless data integration and processing. Additionally, I have solid development experience in building web applications with Python frameworks, and I am familiar with tools such as Spotfire and QlikSense.
